# submission

-- All the experiments code files:  thailand-CUBEM.ipynb , UWC.ipynb, Canada-square.ipynb

-- All datasets for the three notebook experiments, including energy datasets and weather  
Datasets.

To run these code, please upload them to CoLab, as I have conducted all the experiments on CoLab, if using different platform, I can’t guarantee the performance or whether there’s going to be errors regarding running environments. After uploading the notebook files, please create a Google Drive named “project”, as that’s the name which I used for root directory storing datasets in my CoLab. Place all the datasets from my GitHub or from submitted zipped folder , into this drive “project”, the code for connecting Google Drive is already in the file, just run them. 

Note: please relocate the sub-directories or data files according to the csv_path in config of each notebook file.
